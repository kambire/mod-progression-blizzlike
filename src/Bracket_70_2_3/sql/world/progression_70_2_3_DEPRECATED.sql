-- DEPRECATED: This bracket should be reorganized
-- NOTE: Ogri'la world quests and daily content should be in Bracket_70_6_1
-- This is a placeholder to document the current state

-- Ogri'la World Content (Island Content)
-- Blades of the Fallen Prince quests
-- Ogre daily quests

-- This content is WORLD CONTENT, not a raid tier
-- It should be grouped with Isle of Quel'Danas content in Bracket_70_6_1

-- If you have Ogri'la content here:
-- 1. Back up this file
-- 2. Move quest_template entries to Bracket_70_6_1
-- 3. Move NPC vendor entries to Bracket_70_6_1
-- 4. Delete this bracket or repurpose it

-- Example of content that might be here:
-- - Quest: "Bladespire Clan Feud" chain
-- - Repeatable: "Kill Gronn Ogres"
-- - Quest: "Haleskor the Deathless"

-- For now, this bracket is documented as WORLD CONTENT PLACEHOLDER
-- Proper configuration depends on which Ogri'la quests are actually installed

-- Update: This should be reorganized into Bracket_70_6_1 (Isle of Quel'Danas)
-- as per Blizzard's original content release schedule
